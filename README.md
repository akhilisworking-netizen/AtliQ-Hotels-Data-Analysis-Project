# AtliQ-Hotels-Data-Analysis-Project
This project involved a Python data analysis for Atliq Grands, a major Indian hotel chain, to address declining revenue and market share. Key insights revealed high weekend (72.39%) vs. low weekday (50.90%) occupancy, with Delhi leading cities (61.61%). Strategies focus on strengthening weekday performance and expanding demand in weaker segments.
