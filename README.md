# AtliQ-Hotels-Data-Analysis-Project
This project involved a Python data analysis for Atliq Grands, a major Indian hotel chain, to address declining revenue and market share. Key insights revealed high weekend (72.39%) vs. low weekday (50.90%) occupancy, with Delhi leading cities (61.61%). Strategies focus on strengthening weekday performance and expanding demand in weaker segments.

Atliq Hotel Analysis Project — Python

Problem Statement:
Atliq Grands, a major player in India’s hospitality industry, is facing increasing competition, declining revenues, and a loss of market share. To address these challenges, the management team has decided to rely on data-driven insights. Since internal expertise in analytics is limited, they have engaged external support to evaluate the situation, provide actionable insights, and design strategies for customer retention and revenue growth.
Project Goal:
The goal of this project is to perform a comprehensive analysis of the hotel industry domain using Python. By leveraging data-driven techniques and strategic recommendations, the objective is to empower Atliq Grands to make informed decisions. The ultimate aim is to help the company regain its competitive edge, counter revenue decline, and recover lost market share.
Datasets:
- dim_date.csv
- dim_hotels.csv
- dim_rooms.csv
- fact_bookings.csv
- new_data_august.csv
- fact_aggregated_bookings.csv
Data Analysis Process:
- Data Import & Exploration – Imported datasets such as bookings, hotels, and room categories, and assessed their structure and quality.
- Data Cleaning – Addressed missing values, corrected inconsistencies, and removed outliers to ensure reliable analysis.
- Data Transformation – Created new variables like occupancy percentage and merged datasets for a holistic view.
- Insights & Visualization – Analyzed occupancy, revenue, and booking trends, and visualized findings using Python libraries.
- Key Insights Summary – Consolidated findings into clear, actionable insights.
- Recommendations – Proposed strategies to address the identified challenges.
Tools & Functions Used:
- Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis (groupby, merge, describe).
- NumPy: Numerical operations and derived metrics (e.g., occupancy percentage).
- Matplotlib: Visualization (bar charts, pie charts, line plots).
- Data Cleaning Techniques: Missing value imputation, format corrections, outlier removal.
Key Insights:
- Presidential rooms have the highest average occupancy (59.30%), while Elite and Premium rooms show the lowest (~58%).
- Delhi has the highest average occupancy rate (61.61%), while Bangalore has the lowest (56.59%).
- Occupancy is significantly higher on weekends (72.39%) compared to weekdays (50.90%).
- In June, Delhi recorded the highest occupancy (62.47%), while Bangalore had the lowest (56.58%).
- Mumbai generates the highest revenue ($668,569,251), while Bangalore generates the lowest ($420,383,550).
- Atliq Exotica leads in revenue ($32,436,799), while Atliq Seasons records the lowest ($6,672,245).
- Delhi has the highest average rating (3.79), while Bangalore has the lowest (3.41).
Recommendations:
- Promote less popular room types and cities through targeted campaigns and partnerships.
- Enhance weekday occupancy with corporate tie-ups and weekday-specific offers.
- Adjust strategies based on revenue and ratings, focusing on weaker-performing cities and hotel types.
- Regularly integrate and analyze new data to guide forecasts and proactive decisions.
- Improve customer satisfaction by investing in staff training and service quality, especially in low-rated locations.
- Optimize marketing efforts by tailoring campaigns to high-potential markets using historical data.
Key Learnings:
- Data cleaning is essential for accuracy and reliability.
- Visualization tools like Matplotlib and Pandas are crucial for presenting insights clearly.
- Strategic analysis through merged datasets and derived metrics reveals hidden patterns critical for decision-making.
Conclusion:
This project provided valuable experience in applying Python-based data analysis to real-world business challenges. The insights generated offer Atliq Grands a roadmap to strengthen competitiveness, improve customer satisfaction, and drive sustainable revenue growth.
